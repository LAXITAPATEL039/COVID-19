# COVID-19
The COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization System is a data-driven project designed to analyze, visualize, and interpret COVID-19 pandemic data using computational techniques. The main objective of this project is to provide meaningful insights into the spread, impact, and trends of COVID-19 cases across different regions and time periods.  The project uses real-world COVID-19 datasets containing information such as confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, and daily updates. By applying data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques, the system helps users understand how the pandemic evolved and how different regions were affected.  This project is useful for students, researchers, and analysts who want to study pandemic behavior, trends, and patterns using data analysis tools
